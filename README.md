# vim-lsp-settings

Auto configurations for Language Server for [vim-lsp](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp)

## Introduction

Language Servers is not easily to install. Visual Studio Code provide easy way to install/update Language Server and Language Server Client. This plugin provide same feature on Vim.

## Installation instruction

For [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager:

```viml
Plug 'prabirshrestha/async.vim'
Plug 'prabirshrestha/asyncomplete.vim'
Plug 'prabirshrestha/asyncomplete-lsp.vim'
Plug 'prabirshrestha/vim-lsp'
Plug 'mattn/vim-lsp-settings'
```

You need to install both [vim-lsp](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp) and its accompanying plugins and vim-lsp-settings.

### Notice

If you use plugin manager that is merging  plugins (ex. dein), Please setting stop merging work(ex. dein / merged = 0) or set `g:lsp_settings_servers_dir` option to a different directory from the vim-lsp's default.

_reason_:

Servers are installed in `./servers` directory at the caching area in default.
But when rebuild the cache, any merging plugin manager erases old cached files(include `./servers` and server execute files) before install.
You can change the directory to install servers by set `g:lsp_settings_servers_dir` option in full path.

## Usage

If you install rls already, you can use rls without configurations. But if you not installed rls yet, you can install it by following [this instruction](https://github.com/rust-lang/rls#setup).

If you install clangd already, you can use clangd for C/C++ without configurations. But if you install clang with named clangd-6.0, you can replace executable like below:

```vim
let g:lsp_settings = {
\  'clangd': {'cmd': ['clangd-6.0']}
\}
```

Overridable keys are:

* cmd (List ex: `['clangd-6.0', '-enable-snippets']`)
* initialization_options (Dictionary)
* whitelist (List)
* blacklist (List)
* config (Dictionary)
* workspace_config (Dictionary)

If you install ruby but not solargraph, you can install solargraph with following command.

```
:LspInstallServer
```

Currently, no way to uninstall/update server. Run this command again, newer version will be installed.
